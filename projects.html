            <h3>Field Session Project</h3>
            <p>This project was completed as part of a field session, a capstone course at my university. For this project, I collaborated with a team of three to assist 
                our client, the Rocky Mountain Lab Rescueâ€”a nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing and rehoming dogs. The rescue relies heavily on donations 
                generated from merchandise sales, both online and at in-person events. Our client wanted to make more informed decisions when ordering new merchandise by 
                analyzing inventory trends. They requested that our team build a dashboard to visualize their inventory data and predict future inventory needs based on key factors.
                <br>
                To tackle this project, our team divided the work into three components: front-end development, back-end development, and machine learning. I was responsible 
                for the machine learning component. My role involved performing data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for modeling. I then developed 
                a Random Forest regression model to predict future sales based on factors such as the time of year and the type of merchandise.
                <br>
                The final deliverable was a dashboard that displays the current inventory alongside predicted inventory levels for the next year, categorized by item. While the model 
                was trained on just four months of data, its accuracy will improve as more data is added.
                <br>
                Our client was very pleased with the dashboard, as it will enable them to better anticipate periods of high demandâ€”especially during specific seasons and 
                after major events.

            <h3>Assessing the Predictive Power of Tumor Smoothness and Concavity in Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Generalized Linear Models</h3>
            <p>In this project, I aimed to answer the question: <br> Can the characteristics of smoothness and concavity effectively predict whether a breast cancer
                diagnosis is malignant (â€˜Mâ€™) or benign (â€˜Bâ€™)? <br> Using the breast cancer data set from the UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository, 
                I explored the relationship between tumor smoothness and concavity and breast cancer diagnosis. I fitted
                a generalized linear model to predict the diagnosis based on these two features. I evaluated the modelsâ€™ performance and interpreted the results, connecting back 
                to the original question.

            <p>For my software engineering class, I completed a project where my teammate and I developed a Clue game in Java. 
                This project emphasized object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
                We implemented JUnit to write and execute test cases and used Java AWT to design and build the graphical user interface. </p>
